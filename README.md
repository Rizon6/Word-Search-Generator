# Word-Search-Generator
Word Search Generator is a demonstration of a multi-method program with user input and low redundancy. This allows us to test multiple ways to place a word in the word search box with ease before it is placed, as well as take user input to store data for the words for the word search.

WordSearchGenerator: This class includes methods for an intro, generating words and the grid, placing words with correct direction and diagonals, printing the word search, and finally showing a solution.
In this way we are able to create a database of words, place them on a grid in correct direction, print the grid (word search) for the player, and then show them the correct answer at the end by leveraging x's in place of incorrect areas.
